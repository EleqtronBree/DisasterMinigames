# DisasterMinigames
Project for Envia designed on Roblox Studio (Jun 2020)

The Disaster Minigames is a Roblox game where players survive each disaster that hits. Players can earn virtual currency and use them to purchase gear, power ups and disaster requests. The project is currently active, hence not all core code has been uploaded.
